This repo is just some code I wrote while following along with this Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-solve-math-problems

Just plain HTML and JavaScript (pulling in bootstrap and JQuery).

Optionally use node and run `npm install` to install browsersync and `npm start` to serve the code in a local server and auto refresh browser on changes.
